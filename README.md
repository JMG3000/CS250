# CS-250 Software Development Life Cycles

Throughout CS-250, I strengthened my abilities in collaborative problem-solving, Agile development practices, and transforming user requirements into practical software solutions. These skills will guide my professional work as I collaborate with development teams, communicate across technical boundaries, and adapt to evolving project needs. As part of the course’s concluding reflection, I was asked to address several essential questions that highlight my understanding of software development life cycles, and the following responses represent that reflection.

Q1). How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A1). Interpreting user needs begins with actively listening to stakeholders and translating their goals into clear, actionable requirements. I approach this by identifying what the user is trying to accomplish, the constraints they face, and the value the software should provide. Creating user stories is especially helpful in this process because they frame requirements from the user’s perspective, ensuring development decisions remain focused on usability and real-world needs rather than purely technical considerations.

Q2). How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

A2). When developing programs, I follow an incremental and structured approach. I start by planning and designing the solution, then implement features in manageable stages, testing frequently to catch issues early. This method allows for flexibility and improvement without overwhelming the development process. Agile methodologies support this approach by emphasizing adaptability, continuous feedback, and iterative progress.

In my future development work, I hope to incorporate Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily check-ins, and retrospectives. These practices encourage transparency, improve collaboration, and allow teams to respond effectively to changing requirements. Agile also promotes delivering functional software regularly, which helps maintain momentum and stakeholder confidence.

Q3). What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A3). Being a good team member in software development means contributing not only technical skills but also reliability, communication, and shared accountability to the team’s success. I strive to communicate progress and obstacles clearly, respect differing perspectives, and adapt my approach when collaboration reveals a better solution—because in software, the best ideas rarely compile in isolation. A strong team member supports collective goals, responds constructively to feedback, and understands that writing maintainable, well-documented code is just as important as writing code that works. In practice, teamwork is the difference between a project that merely runs and one that actually ships without catching fire.

Ultimately, this course highlights why disciplined software development practices are foundational to the field of software engineering. By emphasizing Agile methodologies, collaboration, and user-centered design, CS-250 reflects the realities of modern software development and prepares students to contribute meaningfully to complex, real-world systems. The concepts explored in this course extend beyond academic exercises, shaping the professional standards, ethical responsibilities, and collaborative expectations that define effective software engineering today.
